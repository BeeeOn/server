= Functional tests =

This directory contains functional tests of the server. Each test suite
usually require the server or some its parts to be started manually
prior to testing.

The tests are written in Python 3. Required Python libraries:

* unittest-tap-reporting
* see t0000-selftest.py for more required libraries


== Install unittest-tap-reporting ==

Via RPM:

  $ https://github.com/vit1251/unittest-tap-reporting.git
  # yum install python-babel
  $ (cd unittest-tap-reporting && python2 setup.py bdist --formats=rpm)
  # rpm -i unittest-tap-reporting/dist/unittest-tap-reporting-0.1-1.noarch.rpm

Via easy_install:

  # easy_install unittest-tap-reporting


== Run tests ==

Just start all the t####-* files:

  $ for t in t[0-9]*; do
      ./${t}
    done


== Run tests using prove ===

  $ prove t[0-9]*


== Run single test ==

Simply execute the selected testing script:

  $ ./t0000-selftest.py

To execute a selected subtest, you can specify the subtest on
the command line like:

  $ ./t0000-selftest.py TestSelf.test1_self


== New test template ==

See t0000-selftest.py that test whether the testing environment is
set up correctly. Use the t0000-selftest.py as the starting template
for new tests.
